This is a partial Python-to-TypeScript-and-WepGPU port of a cellular automaton game that is learnable with evolutionary algorithms.

There is a compute shader that evaluates sequences.

This parrallelization will be compared with regular web workers, which will most likely be the architecture in the final www.nets-vs-automata.net/rl.html verion.  

Lots of issues with Evolve, Manual, and Demo modes. Work in Progress.
